"""Helpers for working with Flask globals.

Flask makes heavy use of proxy objects. Depending on the context in which code
is being executed, many of the Flask globals will refer to different things
(or sometimes nothing at all). It is nice to be able to write code without
handling the various scenarios that this creates. That's what this module is
for: instead of accessing proxies directly, the functions here will access
proxies appropriately depending on the context, and return the appropriate
object.
