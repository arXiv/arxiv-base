"""These tests check for possible problems with apps that use this package.

Usage
-----
You can import all of the tests in this module, and run them with the built in
test runner. E.g.

.. code-block:: python

   # my_app_tests.py
   import unittest

   from my_app.factory import create_web_app
   from arxiv.base.app_tests import *

   app = create_web_app()

   if __name__ == '__main__':
       with app.app_context():
           unittest.main()


And run with:

.. code-block:: bash

   pipenv run python my_app_tests.py
